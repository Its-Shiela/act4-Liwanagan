                        <p>Like your friends were the night that we first met</p>
                        <p>Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet</p>
                        <p>Now I've read all of the books beside your bed</p>
                        <p>The wine is cold</p>
                        <p>Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street</p>
                        <p>Cat and mouse for a month or two or three</p>
                        <p>Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe</p>
                        <p>(Ayy)</p>
                        <p>Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)</p>
                        <p>Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)</p>
                        <p>Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)</p>
                        <p>I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings</p>

                        <p>In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool</p>
                        <p>When you jumped in first, I went in too</p>
                        <p>I'm with you even if it makes me blue</p>
                        <p>Which takes me back</p>
                        <p>To the color that we painted your brother's wall</p>
                        <p>Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws</p>
                        <p>We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so</p>
